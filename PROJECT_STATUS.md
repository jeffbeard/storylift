# StoryLift Project Status

## üéâ Current Status: Story Suggestions System Complete

**Last Updated:** September 16, 2025

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed Features

#### Story Suggestions API & UI (Just Completed)
- **Story Suggestions API Endpoint** (`GET /matching/suggestions/:jobId`)
  - Provides intelligent story-to-requirement mapping suggestions
  - Returns match scores and mapping status
  - Integrates with existing story matching service

- **StorySuggestions UI Page** (`/jobs/:jobId/suggestions`)
  - Comprehensive interface for viewing story suggestions
  - Interactive story mapping with real-time feedback
  - Visual indicators for already-mapped stories
  - Match confidence scores (percentage-based)
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop

- **Integration with Job Upload Flow**
  - Job uploads now redirect directly to suggestions page
  - Enhanced Job Detail View with "Get Story Suggestions" button
  - Updated JobDetail to use newer matching API

#### Database Schema Fix
- **Fixed Legacy `requirement_id` Column Issue**
  - Removed obsolete `requirement_id` column from `star_stories` table
  - This was causing "Field 'requirement_id' doesn't have a default value" errors
  - System now properly uses `story_requirement_mappings` table for many-to-many relationships
  - Dropped foreign key constraint `star_stories_ibfk_1`

#### STAR Stories Data Import
- **Successfully Loaded 4 Complete STAR Stories for User ID 2:**
  1. **College Recruiting Program** (ID: 1) - 212% engineer intake boost
  2. **Infrastructure Product Management Function** (ID: 2) - Consolidated 6 teams, 700+ employees
  3. **Product Lead for SaFE and quarterly planning** (ID: 3) - 98% task reduction
  4. **Migrated to GitLab Security Scanning systems** (ID: 4) - 4,000+ projects, $250K savings

### üèóÔ∏è Complete System Architecture

**Backend API:**
- User management with authentication
- Job description upload and processing (PDF/URL)
- STAR stories CRUD operations
- Intelligent story-requirement matching service
- Story suggestions endpoint with match scoring

**Frontend:**
- User registration and login system
- Job upload and management
- Story suggestions interface with mapping capabilities
- Job detail views with integrated suggestions access
- Responsive design throughout

**Database:**
- Users table with proper authentication
- Job descriptions with user ownership
- Requirements extracted from jobs
- STAR stories with full STAR structure
- Story-requirement mappings (many-to-many)
- Proper indexing for performance

## üß™ Next Steps - Testing & Validation

### Immediate Testing (Priority 1)
1. **End-to-End User Flow Testing**
   - Log in as user_id 2 (storylift1@cyberxape.com)
   - Upload a new job description
   - Verify automatic redirect to suggestions page
   - Check if 4 STAR stories appear with match scores

2. **Story Mapping Functionality**
   - Test mapping suggested stories to job requirements
   - Verify mappings persist in database
   - Confirm mapped stories show as "already mapped"

3. **Job Detail Integration**
   - Navigate to job details to see mapped stories
   - Test "Get Story Suggestions" button functionality

### Potential Issues to Watch For
- Frontend/backend connectivity on port 3001
