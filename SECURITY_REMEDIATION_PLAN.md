# Security Vulnerabilities Remediation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the security vulnerabilities identified by GitHub code scanning and provides a structured plan to resolve each issue across multiple development sessions.

## Identified Security Issues

### 1. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - HIGH PRIORITY**
**Location**: `/backend/routes/jobs.js:193` (axios.get with user-provided URL)
**Risk Level**: High
**Description**: The application accepts user-provided URLs and makes HTTP requests without validation, potentially allowing attackers to access internal resources.

**Remediation Steps**:
- [ ] Implement URL validation to only allow specific domains/protocols
- [ ] Add URL allowlist for approved job posting sites
- [ ] Implement request timeout and size limits
- [ ] Use a proxy service or dedicated scraping service for external requests

### 2. **SQL Injection Prevention - HIGH PRIORITY**
**Location**: Multiple files using parameterized queries
**Risk Level**: High
**Description**: While the code uses parameterized queries, ensure all dynamic SQL construction is secure.

**Remediation Steps**:
- [ ] Audit all database queries for proper parameterization
- [ ] Implement input validation middleware
- [ ] Add SQL query logging for security monitoring
- [ ] Consider using an ORM for additional protection

### 3. **File Upload Security - MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Location**: `/backend/routes/jobs.js:125` (PDF upload functionality)
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Description**: File upload functionality may allow malicious file uploads.

**Remediation Steps**:
- [ ] Implement file type validation beyond extension checking
- [ ] Add file size limits
- [ ] Scan uploaded files in a sandboxed environment
- [ ] Store uploaded files outside of web-accessible directories
- [ ] Implement virus scanning for uploaded files

### 4. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention - MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Location**: Frontend components rendering user content
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Description**: User-generated content may not be properly sanitized.

**Remediation Steps**:
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- [ ] Sanitize all user input before rendering
- [ ] Use React's built-in XSS protection properly
- [ ] Validate and escape content extracted from URLs/PDFs

### 5. **Authentication & Authorization - HIGH PRIORITY**
**Location**: `/backend/routes/users.js` (simple email-based auth)
**Risk Level**: High
**Description**: Current authentication system is insufficient for production use.

**Remediation Steps**:
- [ ] Implement proper password-based authentication
- [ ] Add JWT token-based session management
- [ ] Implement role-based access control
- [ ] Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- [ ] Implement secure password storage (bcrypt/argon2)

### 6. **Information Disclosure - MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Location**: Error handling throughout the application
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Description**: Error messages may expose sensitive system information.

**Remediation Steps**:
- [ ] Implement generic error messages for production
- [ ] Add proper error logging without exposing stack traces
- [ ] Remove database error details from API responses
- [ ] Implement environment-specific error handling

### 7. **Dependency Vulnerabilities - MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Location**: `package.json` files
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Description**: Dependencies may have known security vulnerabilities.

**Remediation Steps**:
- [ ] Run `npm audit` and fix all high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Update all dependencies to latest stable versions
- [ ] Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Consider using `npm-audit-resolver` for managing audit fixes

### 8. **Missing Security Headers - LOW PRIORITY**
**Location**: `server.js` Express configuration
**Risk Level**: Low
**Description**: Missing security headers make the application vulnerable to various attacks.

**Remediation Steps**:
- [ ] Implement helmet.js for security headers
- [ ] Add HTTPS redirect middleware
- [ ] Implement proper CORS configuration
- [ ] Add request rate limiting

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Critical - Complete First)
1. SSRF vulnerability mitigation
2. Authentication system overhaul
3. SQL injection audit and fixes

### Phase 2 (High Priority)
4. File upload security improvements
5. XSS prevention measures
6. Error handling security

### Phase 3 (Medium Priority)
7. Dependency vulnerability fixes
8. Security headers implementation

## Session-by-Session Implementation Plan

### Session 1: SSRF Protection
- Implement URL validation and allowlist
- Add request timeouts and size limits
- Test with various URL inputs

### Session 2: Authentication Security
- Implement password-based authentication
- Add JWT token management
- Implement rate limiting

### Session 3: File Upload & XSS Prevention
- Secure file upload processing
- Implement CSP headers
- Add input sanitization

### Session 4: Dependency & Infrastructure Security
- Update vulnerable dependencies
- Add security headers with helmet.js
- Implement proper error handling

### Session 5: Testing & Validation
- Security testing of all implemented fixes
- Penetration testing of critical endpoints
- Code review and final validation

## Testing Checklist

After implementing each fix:
- [ ] Verify the vulnerability is patched
- [ ] Ensure no functionality regression
- [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Update documentation and code comments
- [ ] Run automated security scans

## Monitoring & Maintenance

Post-remediation:
- [ ] Set up security monitoring alerts
- [ ] Implement regular security scans
- [ ] Create security review process for code changes
- [ ] Schedule quarterly security assessments

## Resources & Tools

- **Security Scanning**: GitHub Advanced Security, Snyk, OWASP ZAP
- **Dependencies**: `npm audit`, Dependabot, Snyk
- **Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Postman for API security testing
- **Documentation**: OWASP Top 10, Node.js Security Checklist

## Notes

- Each vulnerability fix should be implemented in a separate feature branch
- All changes must include unit tests and security tests
- Security fixes should be prioritized over new features
- Consider security training for the development team
